Equilibration Protocol

Prior to production MD, a multi-stage equilibration protocol was employed to gradually relax the system and ensure proper thermalization and structural integrity of the protein-membrane environment. This protocol was designed to minimize artifacts arising from unfavorable contacts, non-equilibrium solvent distributions, and membrane perturbations during system assembly.
Equilibration began with Brownian dynamics under NVT conditions at 10 K, using strong harmonic positional restraints (50 kcal/mol/Å²) on all solute heavy atoms. This phase (50 ps) allowed solvent and lipid molecules to relax around a fixed protein scaffold, reducing steric clashes without introducing significant atomic motion.
Next, the system was transitioned to Brownian NPT dynamics at 100 K and 1000 bar for 20 ps, with harmonic restraints (20 kcal/mol/Å²) maintained on solute heavy atoms and additional z-axis restraints (5 kcal/mol/Å²) applied to membrane heavy atoms. This step permitted limited volume relaxation and further solvent equilibration, while restricting large-scale protein and membrane movements.
Subsequently, an NPgT ensemble (constant number of particles, pressure, surface tension, and temperature) was employed at 100 K and 1000 bar for 100 ps. Restraints were reduced to 10 kcal/mol/Å² on solute heavy atoms and 2 kcal/mol/Å² on phosphorus and nitrogen atoms in the membrane, allowing increased flexibility and relaxation in both the protein and lipid environment.
Gradual heating from 100 K to 300 K was then performed over 150 ps in the NPgT ensemble, with a scheduled, stepwise release of positional restraints on the solute and membrane. This phase allowed the system to reach the target simulation temperature while maintaining overall stability and minimizing the risk of structural disruption.
Final equilibration steps were conducted under NVT conditions at 300 K for 50 ps, with minimal restraints (5 kcal/mol/Å²) on non-hydrogen protein backbone and ligand atoms, followed by a further NVT phase at 310.1 K for 50 ps without restraints. This ensured complete adaptation of the system to the target temperature and removal of all positional constraints prior to production sampling.
Overall, this multi-step equilibration protocol allowed for a controlled and artifact-free transition from the initial, pre-assembled state to stable, unbiased molecular dynamics at physiological conditions.
