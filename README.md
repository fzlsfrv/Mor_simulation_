# Simulation pipeline for mu-opioid receptor in the lipid bilayer consisting of POPC molecules
# In equilibration folder, you will find the several scripts, which are different steps of the simulation. The order of the files are explained in equilibration_protocol.txt.
# In Production folder, there are scripts for 50 ns-long simulations in NPAT ensemble, with different restraints. 
# The scripts are supposed to run in Langevin Dynamics only, if the integrator is changed, the structure of the scripts should altered as well.
